	DOM Binding For Tcl

	TclDOM Version 3.1

Steve Ball, Explain

This package provides a DOM binding for Tcl.  It provides one of the following
implementations:

    *     A Tcl-only implementation (slow, but no compilation required),

    *     A C-based implementation based on TclDOMPro (fast),

    *     A wrapper for the Gnome libxml2 library [http://xmlsoft.org/] (also fast
    and compatiable with TclXSLT/libxslt
    [http://tclxml.sourceforge.net/tclxslt.html]).


See the TclXML website [http://tclxml.sourceforge.net/] for more information on
XML support for Tcl.

Contact Steve Ball [mailto:Steve.Ball@zveno.com] for information about this
release.



Installation
============

How you install the package depends on which implementation you require.



Dependencies
------------

All in cases, the following packages must be installed before attempting to
install TclDOM.

Tcllib
    http://dev.scriptics.com/software/tcllib/
    [http://dev.scriptics.com/software/tcllib/]

    In order for the Tcl-only parser to resolve external entities, the tcllib
    package must be installed.

    Be sure to get a version which includes the uri package.  Version 1.2 or better
    is recommended.

        *         GZip'd tarball [ftp://prdownloads.sf.net/tcllib/tcllib-1.7.tar.gz]

        *         ZIP file [ftp://prdownloads.sf.net/tcllib/tcllib-1.7.zip]


    The latest CVS snapshot may be found at the SourceForge project page
    [http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcllib].



TclXML
    First install TclXML version 3.1 [http://tclxml.sourceforge.net/tclxml.html].

    You must install the same numbered version as this package, ie. 3.1.





Pure-Tcl Installation (no compilation required)
-----------------------------------------------

The install.tcl script will install the pure-Tcl DOM implementation.  Run it
using wish, eg.

    wish install.tcl

    If Tcl/Tk has been configured correctly on your system, you should be able to
    simply double-click the script

If the pure-Tcl parser is good enough for you, then read no further.



Compiled Installation
---------------------

If you need the performance of a compiled DOM implementation, then you have
three options:

    *     TclDOM/libxml2

    *     TclDOM/C (a.k.a. TclDOMPro)

    *     tDOM (different API to TclDOM, but similar functionality)




Installing TclDOM/libxml2
-------------------------



Additional Dependencies
-----------------------

In order to build TclDOM/libxml2, first install the TclXML package with libxml2
support - ie. TclXML/libxml2.



Unix/Linux
----------

You must have Tcl/Tk version 8.2 or better installed on your system.  Tcl/Tk
8.3 or better is recommended.

Unpack the TclDOM distribution and cd into the tcldom-3.1/src-libxml2 directory.

Run the configure script, with the --prefix and --enable-threads switches (the
latter only if Tcl has been built with threads enabled).

    If libxml2 was installed in a non-standard location you might have to add the
    --with-libxml2-include and --with-libxml2-lib switches.

    On Windows the iconv library is required too. See
    www.fh-frankfurt.de/~igor/projects/libxml/
    [http://www.fh-frankfurt.de/~igor/projects/libxml/] for either precompiled
    binaries, or a link to the sources.  The relevant options are
    --with-iconv-include and --with-iconv-lib.

For example, on my system I have Tcl 8.4 installed in /usr/local/tcl8.4 so I
would use the command:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/tcl8.4 --enable-threads --with-libxml2-include=/usr/local/include --with-libxml2-lib=/usr/local/lib

    make

    make install

You may have to do this as root



Windows (MS VC++)
-----------------

You must have Tcl/Tk version 8.2 or better installed on your system.  Tcl/Tk
8.3 or better is recommended.

You must have TclXML/libxml2 installed, so you will have already downloaded and
unpacked the libxml2 distribution.

If you have a TEA build environment, just use the normal configure/make/make
install pattern.

Alternatively, the win subdirectory contains a makefile.vc file for Visual
Studio C++ v6.0.  This makefile builds the TclDOM/libxml2 implementation.  In a
Command Prompt window set up your environment so that nmake is on the path (by
running VCVARS32.BAT), then type the following:

    nmake -f makefile.vc TCLDIR=C:\Path\To\Tcl INSTALLDIR=C:\Path\To\Tcl LIBZDIR=C:\Path\To\libz LIBICONVDIR=C:\Path\To\libiconv LIBXML2DIR=C:\Path\To\libxml2 TCLXMLDIR=..\tclxml

As an example, on my system I have Tcl installed in C:\Tcl and the libxml2
binaries unpacked in the directory C:\gnome.  The TCLXMLDIR variable defaults
to ..\tclxml.  Accordingly, I would use the following command line:

    nmake -f makefile.vc TCLDIR=C:\Tcl INSTALLDIR=C:\Tcl LIBZDIR=C:\gnome\zlib-1.1.4.win32 LIBICONVDIR=C:\gnome\libiconv-1.9.1.win32 LIBXML2DIR=C:\gnome\libxml2-2.6.7.win32

Install the package by appending 'install' to the command line used above, for
example:

    nmake -f makefile.vc TCLDIR=C:\Path\To\Tcl INSTALLDIR=C:\Path\To\Tcl LIBZDIR=C:\Path\To\libz LIBICONVDIR=C:\Path\To\libiconv LIBXML2DIR=C:\Path\To\libxml2 TCLXMLDIR=..\tclxml install
