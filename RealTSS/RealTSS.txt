	RealTSS 0.1
	2007
===================================================================

RealTSS is a free, open source real-time scheduling simulator 
written in Tcl/TK. RealTSS is designed to help analyze real-time 
systems. It can be also used as a teaching tool.
RealTSS is developed and maintained by The Postgraduate studies 
and investigation division of the Instituto Tecnologico de 
Mexicali (http://www.itmexicali.edu.mx/posgrado/index.htm).

===================================================================
2.0 Dependencies:

- Tcl/TK 8.5 or higher
- RealTSS uses KIWI to display the resulting execution trace. 
  You can get KIWI here: http://rtportal.upv.es/apps/kiwi/


===================================================================
3.0 Installation

RealTSS is fully written in Tcl/Tk, in order to run RealTSS, you 
need the Tcl/Tk interpreter installed on your system. 
Tcl/TK is available for almost any Unix system and for Windows 
also, it is distributed in binaries or you could very easy compile 
and install it. Refer to the Tcl Developer Xchange 
(http://www.tcl.tk/) homepage for details.

Unix Systems
First, you must find the full pathname of the Tcl/TK interpreter 
which is installed in your system. The name of this interpreter 
is "wish" or "wishN.M" being N.M the version of Tcl/TK that you 
have. You can execute "which wish" for getting the full pathname 
of "wish". Next, edit the first line in the file called "RealTSS" 
and correct the full pathname of "wish" if necessary.
Although is not mandatory, it is recommended that you install and 
configure kiwi on your system in order to visualize the execution 
trace. After you install and configure both Tcl/TK and kiwi You can 
run RealTSS just by executing the file named "RealTSS".

Note:
	If you have another version installed later than 8.5 and you
	decide yo install the new version of tcl8.5 and tk8.5 you must
	also change the links because they call regulary the version
	that have before we installed the new version.
	So to get works fine our simulator we have to change the links:
	
	ln -f /usr/bin/tclsh8.5 /usr/bin/tclsh
	and
	ln -f /usr/bin/wish8.5 /usr/bin/wish
	
	these commands change the links to our new versions of interpre-
	ters installed 

Windows Systems
You should rename the file "RealTSS" to "RealTSS.tcl". You can run 
now RealTSS by double-clicking the icon of the file "RealTSS.tcl". 


===================================================================
4.0 Configuring RealTSS
RealTSS depends on the realtss.ini file to find and load diferent 
information about the environment in wich it runs.
You can edit this file to customize it accordingly to your needs.

wish  = Name of the Tcl/TK interpreter. Only need in Windows.
algos = path to the algorithm directory, default to algo.
kiwi = Kiwi full path (including extension)
language = Language that will be showed in the interface
