##If you want to add a language only you need write a file with the name of your language with the termination of .lng
##and put it in the folder Languages, so this file will have to be equal with the same name of commands
##The first command before the '=' is the name by the way we search in the program, so you can't change this name, all of
##this have to be equal, the command that are next to the '=' is the translate for the language that are you writing.
##Note: all the commands have to be wrote, you can't leave a command without write, because the program will not show
##correctly.
