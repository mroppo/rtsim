TclXML, TclDOM and TclXSLT version 3.0 are now available.

TclXML is a package that provides XML parsing for the Tcl scripting language.
It has three implementations of XML parsers: one written purely in Tcl
and wrappers for the expat and Gnome libxml2 C libraries.

New features of version 3.0 of the TclXML package include the introduction
of the libxml2 library.

TclDOM is a package that implements the W3C DOM interfaces for the
Tcl scripting language.  It also has three implementations: one written
purely in Tcl, one written in C and a wrapper for the Gnome libxml2 C library.

New features of the version 3.0 of the TclDOM package include major
re-engineering to eliminate a serious bug in the use of the libxml2
library, as well as new API features such as node Tcl commands.

TclXSLT is a package that provides a Tcl interface to the Gnome libxslt 
C library.

Sources, and binaries for Mac OS X (Panther) and MS Windows, are available now.
