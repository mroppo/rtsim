		TclXML Test Suite

This directory contains test scripts for TclXML.

The Tcl interfaces to expat, libxml2 and the Tcl-only implementations
of an XML parser may be tested.  The test scripts accept the '-parser'
argument to select which parser class to test.  Accepted values
are 'xml', 'libxml2', 'expat' and 'tclparser'.  Using the 'xml' value
is not recommended, as the appropriate test constraint will not be
set (this will result in various tests being performed that are not
intended for the parser class that is the default - these will likely
fail).

all.tcl will test the parser class given by the 'parser' argument.
If no '-parser' argument is given then all three parser classes will
be tested.

The Tcl testing framework is used for testing TclXML.
The file license.terms in this directory is from the
Tcl distribution, and refers to this file, all.tcl and defs.tcl.
